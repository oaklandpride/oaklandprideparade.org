  Ducks Nest Preschools believe that compassion and tolerance are among our
  highest virtues. At Duck’s Nest children are encouraged to appreciate and
  respect human differences and connect to our natural environment. Our
  schools employ a culturally responsive anti-bias approach to teaching by
  using an affirmative model for gender, race, culture, socio-economic status,
  and differing abilities in an effort to promote equity. We also honor all
  family structures and members of the LGBTQ+ community at Duck’s Nest. We are
  committed to building a program that reflects the diversity of the Bay Area
  and our values and provide to each and ALL of our students, and their
  families, a strong sense of community and belonging.
