description: "Lakeshore Avenue Baptist Church welcomes and affirms all. We celebrate the creativity and faith of our LGBTQ family members. We stand together to proclaim that God’s love is for all people everywhere. We struggle together to oppose the forces of intolerance and hate. We bring love to heal where hate has divided. We raise our voices in song to pour over the shouts of the intolerant."
honor: "To day we honor Rev. Dr. H. James Hopkins, Pastor Jim, who is retiring this month after 37 years of ministry. He lead us as we stepped up our commitment to being an inclusive community. He has been a leader in Oakland's Ceasefire program. Nationally, he has served on the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Freedom."
