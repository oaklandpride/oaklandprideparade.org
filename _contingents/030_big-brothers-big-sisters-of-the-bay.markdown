  About Big Brothers Big Sisters Bay Area's Program: Our urgent and essential
  mission is to create and support one-to-one mentoring relationships that
  ignite the power and promise of youth. We pair young people referred to our
  program by parents, guardians, teachers and social workers with a screened,
  qualified volunteer adult mentor through a comprehensive matching process,
  which emphasizes compatibility, commitment, and child safety. We enroll
  children and youth 8-17 years old across all nine greater Bay Area Counties
  (Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara,
  Solano & Sonoma).
