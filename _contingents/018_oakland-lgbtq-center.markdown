  The Oakland LGBTQ Community Center is a vital hub for the East Bay, dedicated to enhancing the well-being of the LGBTQ+ community and its allies. As the first multi-ethnic, intergenerational, and all-inclusive LGBTQ+ center in California founded and led by Black community activists, the Center provides a wide range of services, from social and educational programs to health and wellness support. They are proud to march in the Oakland Pride Parade, celebrating the diversity, strength, and resilience of the community they serve every day.
