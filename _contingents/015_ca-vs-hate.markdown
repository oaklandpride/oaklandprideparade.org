  The California Civil Rights Department reminds you that ‘there is support
  when you report!’ If you witness or experience any kind of hate or
  discrimination, report it to California Versus Hate. This non-emergency
  hotline can connect you with free support services. You can report
  anonymously, regardless of immigration status, and California Versus Hate is
  not affiliated with law enforcement. Report hate, homophobia, and
  transphobia by calling 833-8-NO-HATE or by visiting C-A-versus-Hate-dot-org.
  Have a happy pride and protect your chosen family with CA vs Hate!
