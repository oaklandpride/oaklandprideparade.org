  For over a century, EBMUD has been quenching the thirst of 1.4 million people in Alameda and Contra Costa counties with top-quality drinking water!  And they’re not stopping there — EBMUD’s wastewater system keeps 740,000 neighbors safe while protecting the beauty and life of our San Francisco Bay! Let’s hear it for clean water, a healthy bay, and EBMUD!
