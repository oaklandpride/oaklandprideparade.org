  The First Unitarian Church of Oakland is a spiritually alive, radically inclusive, justice-based congregation in the heart of Oakland.  We are gay, straight, bi, transgender, cisgender, and ever questioning.  We believe that it is a blessing that you were born, it matters what you do, what you know about God is a piece of the truth, and you don't have to do it alone. You are welcome to join us for worship on Sundays at 10:20, at the corner of 14th St. and Castro, by the 980 freeway.
