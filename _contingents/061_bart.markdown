  BART, or Bay Area Rapid Transit, is the backbone of the Bay Area's public transit system, connecting the East Bay with San Francisco, the Peninsula, and parts of the South Bay. As a proud supporter of Oakland Pride, BART is committed to providing a safe, reliable, and equitable way for everyone to travel and celebrate. Keep an eye out for the BARTmobile, the agency's beloved, smiling train mascot, as it rolls down the parade route!
