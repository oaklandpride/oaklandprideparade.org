  Kaiser Permanente was founded on the simple idea that everyone deserves the
  chance to live a healthy life. That’s why our members can find high-quality,
  affordable care and coverage in one place. They are at the center of
  everything we do — from pioneering new ways to treat cancer to building
  useful tools that make it easier to stay on top of their health. Our
  employees and physicians reflect and embrace the diverse communities we
  serve. We strive to address inequities and disparities in health outcomes by
  providing culturally responsive, equitable care for all our members.
