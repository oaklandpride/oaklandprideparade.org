  The Academy is a small K-8 independent school in Berkeley that has earned a reputation for providing a high quality, rigorous, classical education in a small, nurturing community. The Academy is defined by our insistence that classical education can live in a contemporary world—that we can study the ancients while engaging the urgencies of our time; that we can be rigorous without being rigid; and that we can hold tradition and innovation in the same hand.
