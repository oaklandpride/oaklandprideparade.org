description: "Give it up for Oakland’s At-Large Councilmember, Rowena Brown! Sworn in this January, she’s a proud Black queer woman and lifelong East Bay resident who brings resilience, justice, and community to everything she does. From educator and community organizer to trailblazer at City Hall, Rowena is making sure LGBTQ+ voices are heard loud and clear. Today, she proudly marches alongside Team Brown, members of the Eastbay Stonewall Democratic Club and K. Stewart Foundation, as well as students and faculty from her alma mater, Mills College, to celebrate 15 years of Oakland Pride."
