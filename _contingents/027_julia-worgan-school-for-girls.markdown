  Julia Morgan School for Girls exists because middle school is a crucial
  moment for girls. That’s why every day we deliver an educational experience
  that ignites each student’s confidence and capability. Because when she
  learns to believe in herself as a teen versus an adult, she wastes no time
  in taking the world by storm. We are a 6th-8th grade girls school in
  Oakland, CA.
