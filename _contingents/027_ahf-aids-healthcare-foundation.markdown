  AIDS Healthcare Foundation is the world’s largest HIV and AIDS healthcare organization and now serves more than 2.3 million patients in 48 countries. 
  AHF not only provides cutting-edge medicine and specialized services but also tirelessly fights for political, economic, and social change.
  AHF is on the front lines advocating for affordable housing solutions through its Housing Is A Human Right division and combating food insecurity through its Food for Health programs.
  In the aftermath of the devastating California wildfires this past January, Food for Health provided more than 75,000 free hot meals to individuals affected by or fighting the fires.
  For 38 years, AHF has been growing and innovating, and today it celebrates the 2.3 million people in care and the more than 7,500 dedicated employees who continue to make AHF Strong.
