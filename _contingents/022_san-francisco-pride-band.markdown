  Founded in 1978, the San Francisco Pride Band is the first openly-gay musical organization in the world, inspiring the formation of LGBTQ+ bands, choruses, and performing groups around the globe. The Band continues to perform at a variety of events in the Bay Area and around the country, advocating for equality through music. In the words of the Band's founder Jon Sims, “Our Message is Music!” Today the marching band is led by Artistic Director-- and Oakland resident-- Mike Wong!
