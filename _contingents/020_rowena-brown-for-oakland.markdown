  An East Bay native, Black and Queer woman who lost both of her parents by
  the age of 17, Rowena knows firsthand why the right to healthcare, the right
  to safety, the right to housing, the right to live in a safe, clean
  neighborhood, and having a thriving small business and local economy is
  essential to every Oakland family and our City’s future. Rowena has served
  the people of Oakland with a leadership path that has focused on addressing
  the needs of our most vulnerable residents: working as an 8th-grade
  classroom teacher and providing free eye exams and glasses to K-12 students;
  serving as a job coach and career counselor for dislocated workers,
  re-entry, and disabled adults; and connecting at-risk families to COVID-19
  resources, testing, and healthy food.
