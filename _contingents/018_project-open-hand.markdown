  Since 1985, Project Open Hand has provided meals with love to older adults,
  adults with disabilities, and those living with complex, chronic health
  conditions like HIV/AIDS. Each year, we serve nearly a million meals to
  clients across San Francisco, Alameda, and Contra Costa counties. In 2023,
  Project Open Hand was voted the Best LGBTQ Nonprofit in the Bay Area by Bay
  Area Reporter Readers, and in 2024 we were honored as a California Nonprofit
  of the Year.

  We always strive to honor our dearly departed founder, Ruth Brinker, who
  refused to just stand by and watch as her neighbors suffered from
  malnutrition brought on by AIDS. She started Project Open Hand in 1985 by
  cooking and delivering meals with love to those in need, and her legacy
  lives on today.
