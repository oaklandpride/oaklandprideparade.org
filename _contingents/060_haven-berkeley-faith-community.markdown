  Haven Berkeley Faith Community is a young church that fully includes and celebrates our LGBTQIA+ family members and friends. We are an intergenerational space that seeks to honor the reflection of God in every human being and to reclaim what it means to do church in a way that dismantles systems of oppression like racism, sexism, ableism and homophobia. Whether you are full of belief or doubt, all are invited to be a part of creating a Haven for connection with one another and with God.
honor: 'We honor the legacy of faith leaders like Lonnie Frisbee and the Reverand Pauli Murray, who paved the was as LGBTQ Christians, for the church to become more inclusive.'
