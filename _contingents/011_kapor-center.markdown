  The Kapor Center’s work focuses at the intersection of racial justice and
  technology to create a more inclusive technology sector for all. We work to
  intentionally dismantle barriers to tech and deployment of technologies
  across the Leaky Tech Pipeline through research-driven practices,
  gap-closing investments, increased access to computer science education,
  supporting and partnering with mission-aligned organizations, advocating for
  needed policy change, and more.
