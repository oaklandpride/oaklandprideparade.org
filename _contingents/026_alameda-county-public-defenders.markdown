  The Alameda County Public Defender's Office provides the highest quality of indigent criminal defense by vigorously advocating for the rights of individuals facing criminal charges in adult and juvenile court. Our client-centered practice gives a voice to those whose voices have been silenced by poverty, and we ensure that no one faces the government alone. We protect the wrongfully accused, the homeless, the poor, the unfortunate and the neglected. We fight for those who cannot afford to fight for themselves, we defend the constitutional rights of us all, and we help them navigate a complex and daunting legal system.
  We have a holistic defense practice that incorporates social workers, client advocates and wraparound supportive referral services. Our office employs 60 support staff, 18 investigators, 12 social workers, 7 client advocates, and over 120 lawyers who have attended some of the finest law schools in the nation and are devoted to serving our clients. They speak more than 12 languages and come from diverse ethnic and economic backgrounds. Our practice incorporates criminal felony and misdemeanor defense, collaborative and mental health courts, post-conviction, clean slate record remedies, immigration removal defense, and various community empowerment programs.
