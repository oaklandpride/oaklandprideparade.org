  Hello, District 18 (Alameda, Emeryville, and Oakland). I am Andre Sandford,
  and I am running for State Assembly District 18. I am on a mission to fight
  for the safety of our community after my family, and I experienced a
  traumatic assault. As we celebrate Oakland Pride, let's remember that
  everyone deserves to feel safe, whether on the streets, in their businesses,
  or coming out to their loved ones. That's why I am committed to securing
  increased funding for police, social workers, civilian workers, and
  implementing a statewide youth police cadet program. Your support for me,
  Andre Sandford, for California State Assembly District 18, will ensure
  safety and security for all. Thank you, and let's have a safe pride!
honor: In memory of Ricky Langford dancer for Soul Train
