  UC Berkeley is home to the Gender Equity Resource Center and the Queer
  Alliance Resource Center, along with many other organizations serving LGBTQ+
  campus communities. GenEq is a campus community center focusing on gender
  and sexuality, committed to fostering an inclusive Cal experience for all by
  providing resources, services, education and leadership programs related to
  gender and sexuality. The Queer Alliance Resource Center is one of the
  oldest queer college student organizations in the country that provides
  social and educational programming and acts as an umbrella organization for
  all active queer/trans communities on campus. We empower and enrich the
  experiences of QT+ students, faculty, and staff at UC Berkeley through
  advocacy, service, and engagement.
