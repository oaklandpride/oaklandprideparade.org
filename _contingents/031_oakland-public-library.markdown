  Oakland Public Library empowers all people to explore, connect, and grow.
  From our digital and print collections of books, music, movies, and
  magazines to tools, laptops, seeds, and video games there is something for
  everyone to check out at one of our 16 branches and main library. In
  addition, we offer robust programming and events for children, teens, and
  adults, including Summer Reading and Drag Storytime, adult literacy
  tutoring, arts education, and book clubs. To serve our communities who
  struggle with critical basic needs, OPL partners with the City of Oakland
  department and other agencies to offer responsive services, such as health
  and dental care, summer lunch, employment and crisis management.OPL is an
  inclusive and welcoming environment for all in the LGBTQ+ community and our
  collections and programs reflect this commitment. We are honored to
  participate in this year’s Oakland Pride Parade.
