  St. Paul's Episcopal School is a local independent school next to Lake Merritt. We prepare students to be confident and skilled learners, cultivate in them a strong sense of purpose, and inspire them to be generous and active citizens of the world. St. Paul’s commitment to socioeconomic and racial diversity is comprehensive and intentional, as is the school’s connection to the broader community. Oakland is our classroom.
