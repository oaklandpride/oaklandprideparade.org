  Alameda County Community Food Bank is on a mission to end hunger and its root causes here in Oakland and throughout Alameda County.
  Celebrating its 40th anniversary this year, ACCFB has stood by the unwavering belief that food is a basic human right. ACCFB partners with 400+  community-based organizations across our county to carry out its vital hunger-relief efforts and is also on the forefront of new approaches to ending hunger and poverty, including bold anti-hunger policy change work and food as medicine efforts.
  ACCFB’s strong commitment to equity, access, and belonging is embedded into everything it does, and believes Our Community and economy must be inclusive of everyone, regardless of race, age, gender, family or immigration status, ability, how they worship, or who they love. ACCFB is excited to be marching in the Oakland Pride Parade (it's our first time!), and celebrating the LGBTQ+ community both within the food bank and across the county.
  To learn more about our work and services, please visit the ACCFB table at the vendor space or at accfb.org.
