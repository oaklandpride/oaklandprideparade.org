  Mayor Sheng Thao made history last year as the first Hmong American mayor in
  the United States. From the moment she took office, she has been a tireless
  advocate for Oakland’s diverse communities, including establishing the
  city’s first-ever LGBTQ cultural district: the Oakland Lakeshore LGBTQ
  Cultural District. Mayor Thao is deeply committed to championing equality
  and ensuring that our LGBTQ community, especially our youth and families,
  are protected, supported, and uplifted. She will continue to be a strong
  voice for inclusion and justice in Oakland.
