  Center for Employment Opportunities (CEO) offers individuals just coming
  home from prison the ongoing support necessary to build career capital and
  financial stability. We believe that everyone, regardless of their past,
  deserves the chance to work toward a stronger future for themselves, their
  families, and their communities.
