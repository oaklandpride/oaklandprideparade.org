  We are an Independent K-8 School, we would like to walk near the other local
  independent schools (Park Day, Redwood Day, etc). We are a 501c3, with an
  active fundraising dept that supports our Tuition assistance program. We are
  looking forward to walking in the Parade to promote our diverse school and
  share our joy with the Oakland Community.
