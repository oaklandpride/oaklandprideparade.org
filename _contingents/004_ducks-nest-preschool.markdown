  Duck’s Nest Preschool, with three locations in Oakland and Berkeley, follows a play-based philosophy that supports a child directed Emergent Curriculum. Our unique preschool environments are intentionally designed to support and encourage children’s natural creativity, curiosity, and enthusiasm for learning. At Duck’s Nest we believe that compassion and tolerance are among our highest virtues. We encourage children to appreciate and respect human differences. Our schools employ an anti-bias approach to teaching by using an affirmative model for gender, race, culture, different abilities, and family structure. We are thrilled to march in the Oakland Pride Parade and support our families and community.
honor: 'Our teachers and administrators for creating a welcoming community for all.'
