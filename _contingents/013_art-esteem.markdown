  The Center for ArtEsteem’s mission is to empower individuals to be self-aware and inspired through art, creativity, and education, making positive choices to break the cycle of violence for themselves and their communities.
  We envision a world where everyone is whole, safe, loved, educated and valued. In all our work, ArtEsteem promotes the understanding that we can choose peace over conflict and love over fear.
