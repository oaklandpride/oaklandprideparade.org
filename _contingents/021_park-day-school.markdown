  Diverse family structures are celebrated at Park Day School. Our school has
  a strong tradition of being openly supportive of families with two dads, two
  moms, multiple-parent families, transgender parents, single parents, and all
  the other permutations that constitute loving relationships. Every year,
  Park Day proudly joins the Oakland Pride Parade to contribute our collective
  voice to the call for LGBTQ+ inclusivity, belonging and justice in Oakland
