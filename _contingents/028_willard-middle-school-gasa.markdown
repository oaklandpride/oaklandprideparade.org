  Willard GASA is a safe space for LGBTQ+ people and their allies. It is a
  student-led group where we learn about news and issues in the Queer
  community and talk about ways to raise awareness about them in our school.
  We welcome all students in every grade level. This year is our 25th
  anniversary!
