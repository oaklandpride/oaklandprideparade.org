Thank you for taking part in the Oakland Pride Parade. Marching in the parade is a unique experience and should be a fun time for everybody. 
The parade itself is enormous, with 10s of 1000s of participants. 
As a participant, the more you know, the smoother the parade will go.

Your parade group , or contingent, will either be a walking contingent or a motorized contingent, and each have different roles. 
As a member of a walking contingent, your role will either be as a marcher who remains on foot for the duration of the parade, 
or a contingent monitor who organizes and sets the pace for your group. 
Motorized contingents additionally have drivers who operate the vehicle wheel monitors who protect marchers from the vehicle's wheels and likely passengers who ride in or on the vehicle. 
It is important that you know your role and what is expected of you before the day of the parade. 
There are five stages of the parade, and each role has different responsibilities in each stage.

the stages in order are:
1. arrival: getting to the assembly area. 
2. Assembly: getting your contingent set up in the correct order.
3. step off: getting your contingent ready to go.
4. On the route: more commonly known as the parade itself and
5. dispersal: properly exiting from the parade area.

Arrival, the assembly area is where we gather all of the contingents together. In order, your contingent will assemble South of Market Street on Stewart spear main or Beale Street. Each block has a letter, and you will find out which block your group is assigned to. Once the parade order is finalized, drivers are the first to arrive on site for your contingent, we start lining up vehicles at 630 on the morning of the parade. If your group is assigned to Stewart, any vehicle should be in place by 8:30am

if your group is assigned a spear, any vehicle should be in place by 9am if your group is assigned to main or Beale, then your vehicle should be in place no later than 9:30am

groups on North blocks, Q, M, J and e should enter the assembly area on Mission Street. Middle blocks, r, n, k, g and h should enter on Howard and South blocks, s, p and l should enter on Folsom.

A block captain will be stationed at the south end of the block, a driver or a contingent monitor from your group must meet with the block captain to check in and receive the parade packet. The parade packet contains detailed parade information, maps, contingent monitor stickers, a contingent number and vehicle permits, contingent monitors and wheel monitors should all wear a monitor sticker on their chest and a vehicle permit should be placed behind the windshield of every vehicle. Your contingent number should be placed on the left side of the windshield of your lead vehicle, or at the top left corner of your leading banner marchers, contingent monitors, wheel monitors and passengers do not need to arrive until later. Groups assigned to Stewart need to arrive by 10am groups on spear need to arrive by 11:15am,

Main Street by 1pm and Beale Street by 2:30pm

please be prepared to wait. Delays can occur, and moving this many people and vehicles can be difficult. Arrival key points lineup begins as early as 6:30am

contingents assigned to Stewart need their vehicles placed by 830 and marchers by 10 on spear vehicles need to be placed by nine and marchers by 1115, on Main vehicles by 930 and marches by one and on Beale vehicles by 930 and marchers by 230 the driver or contingent monitor needs to check in and get the parade packet from the block captain at the south end of their assigned block.

Assembly groups will be shown to their designated gathering spot, and drivers will be shown where to park their vehicles. Drivers should remain near their vehicles at all times because event staff may need them to relocate it.

Drivers need to identify and meet with their assigned wheel monitors during assembly wheel monitors and drivers need to determine how to best notify the driver of a need to stop in an emergency situation. Parade staff will verify that drivers can identify their wheel monitors and will not be allowed to proceed without verification. Please keep your music turned down or off in the assembly area, testing your sound system briefly is fine, but once tested, please leave it off loud music can prevent your contingent and anyone in your vicinity from hearing important information about safety or when and where to move once your contingent is on Market Street, feel free to play your music at your desired level. Please remember, although the atmosphere is fun and lively, we need everyone to remain responsible. You are representing your organization and cause, so you have a.

Responsibility to your fellow participants to act appropriately. Contingent monitors, wheel monitors and drivers should remain free of substances for the duration of the parade, and no one in the assembly area should be getting intoxicated. All participants should wear comfortable walking shoes and packed sunscreen, sunglasses and a hat, as you may be out in the sun for several hours. Make sure to bring water and a healthy snack, as access to food and beverages in the assembly area can be limited. Keep all of your items in a bag you can wear, as there will not be safe places for personal storage. Weapons, illicit substances and glass bottles are strictly prohibited in the assembly area, and you should avoid bringing valuable items that could be targets for theft. Assembly key points, block captains will direct your group and vehicles to their assembly point. Alcohol and substances should be avoided. Bring water and sunscreen and wear comfortable shoes.

Step off

15 minutes before your block is due to start moving a block, Captain will notify drivers to move to their vehicles. At this time, marchers should line up contingent. Monitors should make sure everyone is in place. Passengers should board their vehicles and wheel monitors should take their positions.

Wheel monitor should make sure their designated wheel is clear of people or objects before the vehicle moves. While the vehicle is in motion, they should remain in arm length away from their designated wheel and constantly watch to ensure that nobody gets between them and the wheel. This rule is one that pride takes very seriously. If your group's wheels are not being monitored. Your contingent will be stopped until your monitors are in place. Once the parade assembly starts moving, your group must move with it. The parade will not hold for your contingent for any reason, including vehicle malfunctions or late parade participants. So make sure you are ready and assembled and don't wander away from your group after the announcement for step off reaches your block.

Once your vehicle is in motion, passengers must remain on the vehicle, and marchers must remain off the vehicle until the vehicle comes to a complete stop after the dispersal at the end of the parade, when moving within the assembly area, we load alternating sides onto Market Street by block. The left side of the front block loads first as the front block moves onto Market Street, the second block moves up to take the place of the first, and the lead group waits for the opposite side to load as each side moves independently. It is important to keep your group on your half of the street. Once on Market Street, your group may then expand to the full width of the street. Step off key points. 15 minutes before go time, you will be alerted to get your contingent into formation. Wheel monitors need to get in place and make sure nobody gets between them and their wheel. Your group should stick to your half of the street to allow for alternating sides to load on the route, once directed to proceed onto Market Street, we want to make sure we continue a steady pace on the parade route. Gap monitors will indicate to contingent monitors with signage that a change in pace is needed. Contingent monitors will make sure the rest of the group complies if the parade needs to stop for an emergency situation. Contingent monitors may be asked to assist to move their contingent around a disabled vehicle or clear a path for emergency vehicles to cross. Safety and medical vehicles may need to pass your contingent in the outermost lanes. Marchers should be aware and prepare to clear the path quickly. If your group has a planned performance, the only place you can stop for up to a minute is in front of the grandstand toward the end of the parade. Choreography on the route is fine, but your group must keep pace with the parade as you dance. Do not stop for any photographers or broadcast cameras on the route, even if a TV crew comes to interview you, it is important that you keep moving so you do not cause delays. If your group has items they would like to distribute to visitors, they should be handed to them directly. Throwing objects is strictly prohibited. People can be being struck by even lightweight objects and can hurt themselves trying to catch those thrown out of reach on the route. Key points, gap monitors will alert contingent. Monitors, if a change in pace is needed, performances should only occur at the grandstands and throwing items is strictly prohibited.

Dispersal, as your contingent passes the grandstand, you are entering the dispersal area, a dispersal team member will signal that it's time to cut off all music. Even as we end our parade, you must keep moving. Marchers and contingent monitors should move to the far right of the parade route and continue straight ahead on Market Street, leading them directly to the celebration site at Civic Center. Vehicles with their wheel monitors still.

Place will turn left down each street, drivers should look for a dispersal team member in red groups will be directed to where they can stop to unload passengers. Vehicles may only stop long enough to let passengers off, no unloading of equipment may happen at this time.

Wheel monitors and passengers may then walk to the celebration site, and drivers should take their vehicles off site. If you would like to reconnect with your group after the parade, organize a specific rally point for your group in the celebration area before the parade begins. Dispersal key points, contingent monitors and marchers should move right then exit the parade route straight on market vehicles, passengers and wheel monitors should exit left onto Eighth Street.

Vehicles should stop only to unload passengers. Then drivers should take vehicles off site. Thank you for participating in this year's San Francisco Pride Parade. Please share this video with everyone in your contingent, and we'll see you on the big day. You.
